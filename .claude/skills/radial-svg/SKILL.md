description: >-
  Build or fix a radial/rotationally-symmetric SVG ornament — a mandala, seal,
  ring, knotwork band, badge. Use when making one, or when an existing one reads
  as "scattered / wonky / doesn't form rings / muddy." Encodes the primitives that
  actually work (real circles + N-fold rotated motifs, NOT curved running text),
  the band-height rule, coherent animation, and real Celtic interlace.

# radial-svg — make it read as a clean symmetric wheel

Grounded in the finale mandala rebuild (`src/ui/Mandala.jsx`,
`docs/research/mandala-construction-and-animation.md`). The old one used curved running text on
circle `textPath`s and read as scattered hash; the rebuild uses geometry and reads as crisp rings.

## The primitives (use these, not running text)
- **Skeleton = real `<circle>` keylines.** Concentric circles ALWAYS read as rings. Curved running
  text on a closed `textPath` does **not** — `repeat(n)` overflows and truncates, tight tracking packs
  it into illegible texture, and the bottom arc is upside-down. At most ONE subtle word rim; geometry
  carries the read. (Rebuild: `circles=[472,408,344,280,216,152]`, even ~64px spacing.)
- **Motifs via true N-fold rotation.** Define ONE motif, place it at `rotate(k·360/N)` around center:
  `const ring=(n)=>Array.from({length:n},(_,i)=>i*360/n)`, then
  `{ring(16).map(a=> <path d={petal(...)} transform={`rotate(${a})`}/>)}`. Tiny code, perfect symmetry,
  guaranteed alignment. Helper: `petal(ri,ro,w)` = a leaf between two radii.
- **Band-height ≤ the radial gap.** The #1 "mush" cause: a motif/glyph band taller than the space
  between rings → adjacent bands collide (old bug: `fs72 @ r376` over a 54px gap). Even spacing +
  breathing room between bands.

## Animate coherently (not chaos)
- **≤2 counter-rotating groups**, slow (`.m-spin--out` 120s / `.m-spin--in` 88s); keep the circle
  skeleton + center **still**. NOT one spin per ring — 12 independent spins destroy the symmetry read
  (it looks like rotating static). N-fold symmetry means a slow turn always stays symmetric.
- Reconcile with any container rotation (the finale scroll-jack already spins the whole layer — let
  that be primary; the internal groups add subtle depth). Compositor-only (`transform`); reduced-motion
  → static.
- **PIVOT GOTCHA (cost us a "split mandala"):** to spin a `<g>` around the centre, use
  `transform-box:fill-box; transform-origin:center` — pivot on the group's OWN bbox centre. Do NOT use
  `transform-box:view-box; transform-origin:50% 50%` on a **centred viewBox** (e.g. `-500 -500 1000
  1000`): Chrome resolved `50% 50%` to the viewBox **corner** (user `(500,500)`), not the centre, so the
  whole rotating band got flung a full box-width into the bottom-right while the still skeleton stayed
  centred — a mandala torn in two. `fill-box`+`center` sidesteps the viewBox-origin ambiguity (the
  motifs are authored symmetric, so their bbox centre IS the true centre). The skeleton circles aren't
  in a spin group, so they CAN'T reveal this — you must test the spin groups (see Verify).

## Celtic interlace (if used)
Real plaitwork is **grid-based strict over/under** — what crosses over goes under at the next crossing.
Two offset sine waves are NOT a knot (the old `strand()` mistake); use a proper interlace tile or
crossing-order masks.

## Brand
Ink body + ember rim (`paint-order:stroke fill`) + forge-glow core; let the obsidian veins bleed
through the gaps. Palette tokens only.

## Verify — the geometric QA loop (don't eyeball; MEASURE)
"Rings all over the place / not lined up / not in frame" are **measurable**, so prove them with a
harness, not a screenshot. (The GAELWORX mandala was later removed, so `scripts/mandala-qa.mjs` is
gone — but the harness PATTERN below is the template to recreate for the next radial build, and the
pivot bug it caught is the reason this skill exists.) It ran green and asserted:
- **Deterministic mode:** emulate `prefers-reduced-motion` → Lenis is off (it's only built in
  full-motion), so `window.scrollTo` drives `scrollY` directly. The mandala's placement/scale/opacity
  don't depend on the reduced flag, and circles are rotation-invariant, so killing `.m-spin` perturbs
  nothing measured. Scan the scroll track for the `.fin-mandala` opacity peak, then measure there.
- **Geometry in user units via `getBBox()`** (ignores CSS transforms/filters → clean): every `.m-ring`
  centre on the origin (CONCENTRIC, the "all over the place" check), each radius on its designed mark,
  strictly nested. **Caveat:** `getBBox()` ignores an element's OWN `transform="rotate()"` attribute, so
  it's right for the centred skeleton circles but NOT for placed motifs — for those use `getCTM()` or
  `getBoundingClientRect()`.
- **Layout in CSS px via `getBoundingClientRect()`:** whole box inside the viewport (IN-FRAME), centre
  == viewport centre (CENTERED). Both viewports (393×852 + 1440×900). Exits non-zero on any failure.

Then `qa-route` (0 console errors — SVG/filters compile) + owner reads it on the iPhone 15 (it should
resolve as a banded symmetric wheel that turns as one). The harness guards structure; the eye judges
the aesthetic.
